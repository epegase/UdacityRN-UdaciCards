# Udacity React Nanodegree

## Third Project : UdaciCards

This project was bootstrapped with [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/).

UdaciCardsÂ is a mobile application that allows users to study collections of flashcards.
The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

## `npm start` (How to Install)

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/epegase/UdacityRN-UdaciCards

# navigate to the root directory
cd UdacityReactND-WouldYouRather

# install the dependencies
npm install

# runs the app in the development mode
expo start
```

When you run ==expo start== (or ==npm start==), Expo CLI starts Metro Bundler.

If you want to open the app on your phone or tablet, Go to your app store and install [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client). Open ==Expo Go== and scan the QR Code in Metro Bundler to open the app on your phone/tablet.

## Testing

This app was tested, throught [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client), on this devices :

- For Android, **Samsung Galaxy A10S**
- For iOS, **iPhone SE**

## In Progress

- [ ] Comments and refactoring of codebase
- [ ] Perfomance Optimization
- [ ] Better User Experience (CSS, Reanimated...)
- [ ] Deploy the App in Snack Expo
- [ ] Do a course tutorial for React Native
